# Cascade Parameters are parameters that may have values at site level, 
# aggregated podcast level, or podcast level. Using [cascade] allows Hugo
# to look back up the chain if a given parameter isn't set at the current level 
# being rendered.
# Some of these parameters are for RSS feed generation.
# RSS feed parameters are used for constructing the podcast RSS feed. If these are blank,
# values for any parent aggregated podcasts will be used. If those don't exist because
# there are no parent aggregated podcasts or its values are blank, the default values in
# config.toml rssfeeds parameter section will be used.

# Feed images should be of size 3000px X 3000px
# You can leave this parameter blank if your regular image is already the appropriate size. 
# The theme will default back to that one when feedImage is blank.
# Place images into the static/images directory of your site's files. You may nest them in sub-directories if you wish.
# Define the parameter as filename and path for anything after static/images/
# Ex: image = "weekly-wrap/show-art-large.png" for an image located at 
# static/images/weekly-wrap/show-art-large.png
