This theme is currently a very early work in progress. The goals the Empire Hugo Theme hopes to achieve are as follows:

* Builds websites for podcast networks based on directory structure and front matter parameters.
* The podcast network will be able to host any number of shows and will include a landing page/RSS Feed including all episodes of all shows hosted on the network.
* The theme will automatically build a list page linking all shows on the network.
* Each show will have it's own page and RSS feed.
* Shows can be a simple single directory with an index and content md files or an aggregated show that is made up of smaller subshows such as [BubbleSort TV](https://tv.bubblesort.show).
* The theme will be responsive and support modern features such as dark mode as well as make it easy for users to configure custom color themes.
* Episode pages will provide a modern responsive designed player UI that will emulate a podcast app on mobile.
